Conventions
-----------
* Table names and attribute names use singular form whenever possible e.g. UserRole instead of UserRoles.  Users was chosen b/c "user" is a SQL reserved word.

* Follow Java bean specification whenever possible


To Do
-----
* Fold composite key domain objects (FooId and BarId) into parent domain object -- e.g., ConceptSynonymId should be folded in ConceptSynonym.  See PatientIdentifier and/or PatientIdentifierType for example.
